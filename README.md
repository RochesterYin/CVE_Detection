In this project structure:

The data directory contains your database file (cve_database.db) and the JSON file with CVE data (nvdcve-1.1-2022.json).

The src directory contains your Python source code files:

main.py is the main script for detecting CVEs.
parse_xml.py is a script for parsing XML files, which you might use to parse POM files.
database.py is a script for interacting with the database, such as inserting and querying CVE data.
The results directory is where you can store the output file (result.txt) that contains information about detected vulnerabilities.
